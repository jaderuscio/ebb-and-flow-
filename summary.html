<p>In the article, Dao of Web Design, by John Allsopp, we are given an introduction to web design by looking through the prism of Tao. Daoism, being the philosophy, like in Buddhism, is a way of living, of being the world, which is where this text comes in.</p>
<p>As designers, we are always keeping up with the constant changes and upgrades in technology. We are always evolving, from bad concepts, to good concepts, we adapt into adequate and sensible concepts to them create with.<br>
When we are creating screens to be user friendly to all, we must keep in mind all user types, and utilize this so that screen size, resolution, etc. may be executed for a successful experience.</p>
<p>When it comes to the presentation, CSS is what is used for proper appearance editing purposes, to aid appearance, not control it. HTML should only be used to focus on what your page in itself will do. Use percentages to make the text and spacing sizes, never points or pixels.</p>
<p>There are many user interfaces out there that people will be viewing from, worry only about the functionally and flexibility in how this will be universally applied. Adaptability is most important.</p>
